# Device-connection-detection
Uses a class GUID to find all devices of that type connected to the PC, when the searched for device is found (USB mouse in this case), it is indicated as having been found and connected. The program then starts a timer to keep a connection status check on the device, checking every 5 seconds to ensure that it is still connected or if it has been disconnected
